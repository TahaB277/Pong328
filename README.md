# Pong328
A minimalist implementation of the classic Pong game built for the ATmega328P microcontroller. Programmed entirely in assembly, this project uses a monochrome display and push buttons for paddle control. Designed for simulation in Proteus and real-world circuit realization, it showcases low-level programming and embedded systems concepts.
